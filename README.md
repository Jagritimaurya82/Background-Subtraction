# Binary Segmentation

## Overview

Binary segmentation is a fundamental task in image processing and computer vision where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into one of two classes: foreground or background. This repository provides an implementation of a binary segmentation model using deep learning techniques. The model can be trained on any dataset that contains images and their corresponding binary masks.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes state-of-the-art architectures for binary segmentation.
- **Flexible Data Handling:** Supports various image formats and customizable preprocessing steps.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Includes scripts for training the model and evaluating its performance on a test set.
- **Visualization Tools:** Provides tools to visualize the segmentation results and model performance metrics.
