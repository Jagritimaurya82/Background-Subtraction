# Binary Segmentation

## Overview

Binary segmentation is a fundamental task in image processing and computer vision where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into one of two classes: foreground or background. This repository provides an implementation of a binary segmentation model using deep learning techniques. The model can be trained on any dataset that contains images and their corresponding binary masks.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes state-of-the-art architectures for binary segmentation.
- **Flexible Data Handling:** Supports various image formats and customizable preprocessing steps.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Includes scripts for training the model and evaluating its performance on a test set.
- **Visualization Tools:** Provides tools to visualize the segmentation results and model performance metrics.

 
## How It Works

### Basic Steps

1. **Initialization:** The algorithm starts by creating a model of the background. This can be done using an initial set of frames where the background is assumed to be static.

2. **Foreground Detection:** For each new frame in the video sequence, the algorithm compares the current frame to the background model. Pixels that differ significantly from the background model are considered part of the foreground.

3. **Binary Mask Creation:** A binary mask is generated where foreground pixels are marked as 1 and background pixels are marked as 0.

4. **Background Model Update:** The background model is periodically updated to accommodate changes in the scene, such as lighting variations or moving objects that become part of the background.
